# Python

## Test Mode

To run the script in test mode, you need to change the imports to use the `test_` files instead.

## Camera Setup

Current testing done with camera 3" from table. The resolution appears to be 1440x900, and we can see roughly 3" horizontally. The camera is very out-of-focus for some reason.
