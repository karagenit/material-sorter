# Material Sorter

Sorting Spare Materials (Bolts, Nuts, Washers, etc) - DE Final Project.

## Features

Using a Raspberry Pi Camera, we can categorize bolts according to their length and width. Each type is assigned a bin ID#, which is sent to an Arduino via serial. The Arduino controls a servo to position the appropriate bin for the bolt to be placed into, and displays the ID# on a Seven Segment display.
